# MLR
This repository contains the core code for establishing the MLR(Machine-learning Lost-circulation Risk-index) model, which is developed to quantitatively evaluate the lost circulation risk in drilling operations. 

# Contents overview
The code includes three main modules:

1.Data Preprocessing (Anomaly Value Processing).
This module performs data normalization, anomaly value detection, and outlier handling to ensure data quality before model training.

2.Feature Importance Calculation.
Integrated machine learning algorithms are applied to calculate the feature importance, providing a quantitative evaluation of each input variable's contribution to the lost circulation risk.

3.MLR Model Construction and Validation.
The MLR model is built based on the feature importance results, and its performance is validated using processed data. The model outputs the final risk index to quantify the lost circulation risk.
